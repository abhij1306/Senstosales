# 🔑 API Keys Setup

> [!NOTE]
> As of v2.1, AI summaries in the Reports module have been replaced by deterministic, rule-based SQL insights for 100% accuracy. API keys are still required for the **Voice Agent** features.

## Required API Keys

To use the voice agent, you need to add your API keys to the `.env` file.

### 1. Add to `.env` file

Open `c:\Users\abhij\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\SenstoSales\.env` and add:

```bash
# Groq API (Required for voice features)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant

# OpenRouter API (Optional - for complex queries)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
OPENROUTER_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl:free
```

### 2. Get Your API Keys

**Groq API Key:**
1. Go to https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy and paste it into `.env`

**OpenRouter API Key (Optional):**
1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Go to Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy and paste it into `.env`

### 3. Restart Backend

After adding the keys, restart the backend server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 4. Test

Run the test script again:

```bash
python test_voice_agent.py
```

You should now see successful responses!
